# FEATURES.md - Player Systems & Mechanics Catalog

This document is the canonical, exhaustive reference for all player-facing mechanics in Eternal Momentum. It is derived directly from the original game's source code (`powers.js`, `cores.js`, `talents.js`, `ascension.js`) to ensure a perfect 1-to-1 mechanical port.

## Part 1: Power-up System Mechanics (`powers.js`)

This section details all 18 standard power-ups.

### üõ°Ô∏è Shield (`shield`)
* **Code-Derived Mechanics**:

    * Health is capped at `state.player.maxHealth`.

### üí• Shockwave (`shockwave`)
* **Code-Derived Mechanics**:
    * Creates an expanding shockwave effect originating from the player (or the specified `origin` option).
    * Radius expands to cover the screen (`Math.max(innerWidth, innerHeight)`).
    * Base damage is **15**. If the player's `berserkUntil` timestamp is in the future, damage is **30**.
    * This damage is further multiplied by the player's global damage multipliers.

* **Code-Derived Mechanics**:
    * Fires a `ricochet_projectile` towards the cursor with a speed of **10**.
    * The projectile has **6** bounces. Bounces are consumed by hitting walls or enemies.
    * Base damage is **10**.
    * If the `unstable-payload` talent is purchased, the projectile's size and damage increase with each bounce.

### üí´ Bullet Nova (`bulletNova`)

    * Every **50ms**, this controller fires a `nova_bullet` in a spiraling pattern.
    * Base damage per bullet is **3**. If Berserk is active, damage is **6**.
    * If the `nova-pulsar` talent is purchased, it fires three spirals of bullets instead of one.
