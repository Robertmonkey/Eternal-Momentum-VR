    Hidden 2D canvas.  The original Eternal Momentum game renders into this
    off‑screen canvas.  In this VR port the canvas content is wrapped
    around the player on a cylinder so you can glance up and see the
    familiar 2D battlefield in all directions.  Because the canvas is
    hidden in the DOM, it does not interfere with VR rendering but its
    contents are still updated every frame by script.js.

  <!--
    Off‑screen canvas used by the original Eternal Momentum game.  Its ID is
    "gameCanvas" to satisfy references inside the game code.  The cylinder
    around the player uses this canvas as a texture to project the 2D
    battlefield.  Keep the canvas hidden in the DOM.
