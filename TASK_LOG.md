# Task Log

## 2025-08-01
- Added documentation requirement in `AGENTS.md` instructing developers to record completed tasks in this log.
- Confirmed `FP-01` and `FP-02` implementations remain intact; all unit tests pass.

## 2025-08-02
- Implemented FP-02 fix by syncing player UV coordinates to state and added corresponding unit test.
- Improved UI modules (FP-04) by exporting `holoMaterial`, allowing modal injection and added tests for UI material and modal visibility.
- Updated `showModal` to ignore null entries and added new tests to `package.json`.
- Added noCanvas integration test verifying `gameTick` operates without a DOM canvas.

## 2025-08-03
- Implemented FP-06 step 2 by attaching projectile meshes to a `projectileGroup`
  in `vrGameLoop.js` and updating them in `projectilePhysics3d.js`. Added cleanup
  logic and ensured all tests pass.
