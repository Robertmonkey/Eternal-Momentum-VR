# Task Log

## 2025-08-01
- Added documentation requirement in `AGENTS.md` instructing developers to record completed tasks in this log.
- Confirmed `FP-01` and `FP-02` implementations remain intact; all unit tests pass.

## 2025-08-02
- Implemented FP-02 fix by syncing player UV coordinates to state and added corresponding unit test.
- Improved UI modules (FP-04) by exporting `holoMaterial`, allowing modal injection and added tests for UI material and modal visibility.
- Updated `showModal` to ignore null entries and added new tests to `package.json`.
- Added noCanvas integration test verifying `gameTick` operates without a DOM canvas.

## 2025-08-03
- Implemented FP-06 step 2 by attaching projectile meshes to a `projectileGroup`
  in `vrGameLoop.js` and updating them in `projectilePhysics3d.js`. Added cleanup
  logic and ensured all tests pass.

## 2025-08-03
- Completed FP-06 step 1 by removing the legacy `canvas` object from
  `gameLoop.js`. Replaced all references with `SCREEN_WIDTH` and
  `SCREEN_HEIGHT` constants to decouple the VR loop from DOM canvas
  dimensions. All tests continue to pass.

## 2025-08-04
- Finished FP-06 step 3 by removing the last A-Frame reference from `ui.js`.
  The unlock banner now relies solely on the Three.js UI. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-05
- Started FP-07 by replacing the player's `x` and `y` fields with a
  `THREE.Vector3` position in `state.js`. Updated the player controller,
  game loop and unit tests to use the new vector-based position. All tests
  continue to pass.


## 2025-08-06
- Continued FP-07 by updating `vrGameLoop.js` to read the player's
  3D `position` vector from state. Enemy updates now use this value
  directly. All tests continue to pass.

## 2025-08-07
- Continued FP-07 by making enemy AI read the centralized
  `state.player.position` directly. Updated `enemyAI3d.js`,
  `vrGameLoop.js`, and `gameLoop.js` accordingly and added a new
  unit test `enemyAI3d.test.mjs` to ensure enemies move using the
  shared player position. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-08
- Added FP-04 tests verifying loading progress updates DOM elements and Game Over modal buttons trigger the expected actions.

## 2025-08-09
- Implemented FP-08 by refactoring AudioManager to use three.js AudioListener and PositionalAudio. Added listener setup in vrMain.js and updated main.js for new API. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-10
- Continued FP-07 by replacing the global `window.mousePosition` with
  `state.mousePosition`. Updated PlayerController, powers, cores and
  main.js to use the centralized cursor state. All tests continue to pass.

## 2025-08-11
- Reimplemented Reflector Warden boss AI using original logic and added unit test verifying reflection damage (FP-05).

## 2025-08-12
- Reimplemented Vampire Veil boss AI with healing and pickup mechanics and added
  unit test verifying behaviour (FP-05).

## 2025-08-13
- Improved menu clarity by capturing DOM modals at higher resolution.
  `captureElementToTexture` now scales html2canvas captures by the
  device pixel ratio for crisp UI textures (FP-04).

## 2025-08-14
- Reduced console noise by gating WebXR session logs behind NODE_ENV checks (CI-07).
## 2025-08-15
- Continued FP-07 by removing remaining window.mousePosition references in gameLoop.js to use state.mousePosition.

## 2025-08-16
- Added Gravity Tyrant AI unit test validating gravitational pull effect (FP-05).

## 2025-08-17
- Continued FP-07 by replacing remaining references to `state.player.x` and `state.player.y` in `powers.js` with 3D-aware helpers. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-18
- Continued FP-07 by refactoring cores.js to remove remaining 2D player
  coordinate references. Player position is now read via sphere
  coordinates using getPlayerCoords(). Added epochEnderRewind unit test
  and updated package.json. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-19
- FP-04 cleanup: ModalManager now imports `holoMaterial` from UIManager
  instead of defining a duplicate function. All unit tests continue to
  pass.

## 2025-08-20
  - Continued FP-07 by eliminating the global `window.gameHelpers`. Introduced a
    `gameHelpers` module and initialized it from `gameLoop.js`. Updated
    `PlayerController.js`, `powers.js`, and `main.js` to import this helper object
    directly. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-21
- Continued FP-06 cleanup by removing the obsolete `legacyGameTick` function and
  dummy canvas context from `gameLoop.js`. The VR loop now contains only
  Three.js-based logic. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-22
- Continued FP-07 by removing window dimension and haptic references.
  `powers.js` now uses screen constants and `gameHelpers.pulseControllers`.
  `cores.js` updated accordingly. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-23
- Continued FP-07 by converting enemy objects to store THREE.Vector3 positions. Updated gameLoop spawnEnemy, enemyAI3d, cores logic and tests accordingly. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-24
- Continued FP-07 by migrating pickup objects to store THREE.Vector3 positions.
  Updated gameLoop spawnPickup, cores and VampireAI to push vector-based pickups
  and adjusted legacy bosses. Added new unit test `pickups3d.test.mjs` and
  updated package.json. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-25
- Continued FP-07 by converting ProjectileManager to operate on THREE.Vector3
  positions and velocities. Updated AethelUmbraAI to use the new API and
  refactored the projectileManager test for vector math. All tests pass.

## 2025-08-26
- Audited Fidelity Patch progress and updated documentation. Marked boss implementations as complete and summarized remaining work.

## 2025-08-27
- Completed FP-04 by enabling dynamic DOM modal refresh so stage select and ascension menus display current content in VR.
- Completed FP-05 by adding unit tests for ArchitectAI and SwarmLinkAI behaviours.
- Completed FP-06 by removing legacy main.js entry and switching package.json to use vrMain.js.
- Completed FP-07 final cleanup with modal refresh and added tests. All tests pass.

2025-08-28 – FR-01 – Scene & Lighting improvements
Summary: Replaced cylinder platform with transparent neon grid ring. Added grid helper and ensured ambient + directional lights illuminate bg texture.
Verification: Ran npm test; all suites passed.
Next Steps: Continue FR-01 by tweaking arena lighting brightness if needed, then begin FR-02 settings panel.

2025-08-29 – FR-01 Verification
Summary: Added arenaSphere.test.mjs to confirm the arena loads bg.png texture and uses MeshStandardMaterial with lighting. Updated package.json to run new test.
Verification: `npm test` succeeds with the new test included.
Next Steps: Begin FR-02 by implementing the settings panel UI.

2025-08-29 – FR-01 Correction
Summary: Reverted arena texture usage. The sphere now uses a dark gray MeshStandardMaterial instead of bg.png. Updated README and test accordingly.
Verification: `npm test` to confirm updated arenaSphere test passes.
Next Steps: Proceed with FR-02 settings panel implementation.

2025-08-30 – FR-02 – Settings panel and handedness
Summary: Added settings modal with handedness toggle and volume sliders. Created cog button on HUD to open the panel. Preferences saved via savePlayerState and applied on startup. Controllers now use primary/secondary roles based on handedness.
Verification: Ran npm test after adding new settingsSave test; all suites passed.
Next Steps: Begin FR-03 UI reconstruction using Three.js panels.
2025-08-31 – FR-03 – Stage select UI reconstruction
Summary: Removed html2canvas dependency and legacy DOM modals. Implemented `createStageSelectModal` in ModalManager using Three.js planes and text sprites. Added `startStage` helper and new test `stageSelectModal.test.mjs`. Updated package.json and ascension.js for DOM-less execution.
Verification: `npm test` runs all suites including new stage select test successfully.
Next Steps: Expand FR-03 to rebuild remaining menus (ascension, cores, lore) with interactive panels.
2025-07-31 – FR-03 – Additional menu reconstruction
Summary: Implemented createAscensionModal, createCoresModal, and createLoreModal with interactive buttons. Added tests for each modal and updated package.json.
Verification: npm test – all suites including new modal tests pass.
Next Steps: Continue FR-03 by refining layout details and begin FR-04 state unification.

2025-09-01 – FR-04 – Begin state unification
Summary: Converted `state.mousePosition` to a `THREE.Vector3` and updated PlayerController, powers, cores, gameLoop and bosses to read the vector and convert to canvas coords when needed. Added helper functions in bosses.js.
Verification: `npm test` – all suites pass after the refactor.
Next Steps: Continue FR-04 by replacing all remaining `state.player.x`/`y` references in bosses.js.
2025-09-02 – FR-04 – Boss player position refactor
Summary: Replaced all uses of `state.player.x`/`y` in `modules/bosses.js` with helper functions that read and write the 3D `state.player.position`. Added conversions via `getPlayerCanvasPos` and `setPlayerCanvasPos` for canvas-based calculations.
Verification: Ran `npm test` after refactor; all test suites passed.
Next Steps: Proceed with FR-04 by auditing remaining modules for any stray 2D references.
2025-09-03 – FR-04 – Final state cleanup
Summary: Removed remaining 2D references. Boss petrify zone logic now uses getPlayerCanvasPos instead of player.x/y. Audio core tick effects use an offscreen canvas stub rather than querying #gameCanvas.
Verification: `npm test` – all suites pass.
Next Steps: Begin FR-05 audio integration updates.
